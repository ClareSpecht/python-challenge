# python-challenge
Georgia Tech Data Analytics Boot Camp HW #3
In this exercise, I performed a basic financial analysis on budget data using python and stored the results in a text file for the customer and printed to the command line. I also analyzed election data to determine election results and stored the results in a text file for the election officials and printed to the command line.
